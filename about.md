Hi! I am a Computer Engineer who is currently starting in the world of Data Science and Machine Learning.

I studied a 4 year Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Zaragoza (Spain). Here was where my passion for Machine Learning and Data Science started.

Now, I am studying a Master in Engineering Decision Making at the Rey Juan Carlos University (Madrid, Spain). 

At the same time, I am working in the Data Science Area of Semmantica, a Startup focused on Marketing and Sem. 

In my free time I keep studying and developing my own little projects which you can see here.

For further information about me see my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asabater94/).

If you have any question, don't hesitate to contact me.
