I studied a 4 year Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Zaragoza (Spain). Here was where my passion for Machine Learning and Data Science started.

Now, I am studying a Master in Engineering Decision Making at the Rey Juan Carlos University (Madrid, Spain). 

At the same time, I am working in the Data Science Area of Semmantica, a Startup focused on Marketing and Sem. 

In my free time I keep studying and developing my own little projects which you can se here.
