Hi! I am a PhD student at the [Univesity of Zaragoza](http://www.unizar.es) since November 2019, in the [Robotics, Perception and Real Time Group](http://robots.unizar.es/wp).

My research is mainly focused on using the data extracted from cameras and wearable devices to study user behavior in different scenarios. This task involves the use of Computer Vision and other Machine Learning techniques. Due to the nature of this topic, I am also interested in developing efficient models capable of performing in real-time scenarios.

In my leisure time, I keep studying and developing my own side little projects which you can see here. I am really interested in applying Machine Learning to real-world problems.

If you have any question, don't hesitate to contact me.
